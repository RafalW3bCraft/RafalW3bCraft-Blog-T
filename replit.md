## Project Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript

  - Admin credentials via Replit secrets (ADMIN_USERNAME/ADMIN_PASSWORD)
- **Security**: Session-based auth, audit logging, rate limiting

- OAuth users: Forced to 'user' role, cannot gain admin privileges
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere in codebase
- Comprehensive audit logging for all admin actions
